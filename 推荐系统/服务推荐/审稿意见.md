## review 1

SCORE: 1 (weak accept)
----- TEXT:
Facing a large number of candidate Web services with the same function, users hope to select the most appropriate one. Quality-of-Service (QoS) represents non-functional attributes of Web services and has become a major concern for service selection.

This paper proposes a network biased matrix factorization method for QoS prediction. The method considers both interaction and non-interaction between users and services, which makes it adaptable to complex network environment.

Strength:
\+ Addresses a real-life problem.
\+ Well-organized paper.
\+ A real-world QoS dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the network biased matrix factorization (NBMF) method mentioned in this paper.

Weakness:
\-  For comparison experiments, most of the existing algorithms used for comparison are too old. ~~In Figure 2 and 3, they are only referred to the Impact of Parameter. More basic information needed to be explained in the paragraph. For example, what does the symbol D mean?~~
\-  In order to allow easy reproduction of results, the authors are advised to release their dataset /model as open source.
\-  ~~It is better to have a related works section to make it more clear about the current research states in this fields and what is the advantages of your solution compared with the other's work.~~



## review 2

The paper proposes a network biased matrix factorization (NBMF) method for QoS prediction. The method considers both interaction and non-interaction between users and services. Among the factors related to the non-interaction, the method focuses on the influence of network bias on QoS prediction. Specifically, the method packages network bias into a linear regression model, while putting the user-service interaction into a matrix factorization model, which makes the method adaptable to a complex network environment.

The strengths of the paper are the following:
\- The authors introduce a new network biased matrix factorization method for QoS prediction that considers both interaction and non-interaction between users and services
\- The motivation example in Section II nicely explains the influence of network bias on existing MF-based QoS prediction methods. The network bias makes the QoS prediction made by existing approaches inaccurate.
\- Section III specifies the proposed network biased matrix factorization (NBMF) method for QoS prediction. The authors provide both the mathematical formulation and algorithmic specification (model training) of the proposed method.
\- The authors evaluate their method on a real-world QoS dataset to evaluate the performance of our method. The result demonstrates that our method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art baseline methods.
\- The authors compare their work against six related research works.

The weaknesses of the paper are the following:
\- The related-work section is very short. Further related approaches should have been described. Especially, the approaches that are described should have been  clearly compared against the contribution of the current work of the authors.
\- It seems that one of the issues of the current work is the precision of the proposed method when the latent features have high dimensions. The authors have not explained how their method can/could have addressed this issue.



## review 3

The paper proposes a network-biased matrix factorization (NBMF) method for QoS prediction. Experiments conducted on a real world dataset are reported. The paper is well written. I have some concerns with the paper. 

The paper mainly considers the influence of network bias in QoS prediction. According to the paper, the network bias mainly relates to the location of services and users. Some papers published in recent years have considered the influence of location in QoS prediction. E.g., reference 20, and the followings.  A comparison with these works should be provided.

Jianxun Liu, Mingdong Tang, Zibin Zheng, Xiaoqing Frank Liu, Saixia Lyu:
Location-Aware and Personalized Collaborative Filtering for Web Service Recommendation. IEEE Trans. Serv. Comput. 9(5): 686-699 (2016)

The related work is not well summarized. Only some related works are described. The difference between the proposed work with these existing works is not analyzed. 

~~In the experiment, the competing approaches are published before 2014.  The latest progress in this area should be compared in the experiment.~~
